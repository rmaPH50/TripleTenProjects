# Hello Robert,
# 
# You‚Äôve submitted another project‚Äîgreat work! Your commitment to pushing through the challenges of this program is admirable.
# After reviewing your submission, I‚Äôve returned it with some feedback to help you make the necessary improvements.
# 
# What Was Great:
#  - Good project structure
#  - Nice graphs
#  - Great final conclusion
# 
# Areas to Improve:
#  - It's better to add separate analysis for unrated games/missing users/critics scores
#  - Our recommendation is to shorten the valid period for analysis, as the gaming industry is very dynamic
#     
# Please check my comments below.
# 
# Keep in mind that revisions are a normal and valuable part of the learning process. Use this feedback to refine your work and resubmit when you‚Äôre ready. I know you‚Äôre capable of great things, and I‚Äôm here to support you every step of the way. Keep going‚Äîyou‚Äôre doing a great job! üèÑ

# Video Game Sales Analysis
# Data Description
# The dataset contains information on video game sales from various platforms and regions, along with critic and user reviews. The columns include:
# 
# Name: Name of the game.
# Platform: The gaming platform (e.g., PS4, XBox, PC).
# Year_of_Release: The year the game was released.
# Genre: The genre of the game (e.g., Action, Sports).
# NA_sales: Sales in North America (USD million).
# EU_sales: Sales in Europe (USD million).
# JP_sales: Sales in Japan (USD million).
# Other_sales: Sales in other regions (USD million).
# Critic_Score: Critic review score, with a maximum of 100.
# User_Score: User review score, with a maximum of 10.
# Rating: The ESRB rating of the game.
# Note: Data for 2016 might be incomplete.

# Hypothesis Testing
# In this step, we will perform hypothesis testing to answer two questions:
# 
# Are the average user ratings of Xbox One and PC the same?
# Are the average user ratings for Action and Sports genres different?
# 1. Hypothesis: Xbox One vs. PC User Ratings
# We want to test whether the average user ratings for games on Xbox One (XOne) and PC platforms are the same.

# In[ ]:


from scipy import stats

# Filter the data for Xbox One and PC platforms
xone_ratings = df_games[(df_games['platform'] == 'XOne') & (df_games['user_score'].notna())]['user_score']
pc_ratings = df_games[(df_games['platform'] == 'PC') & (df_games['user_score'].notna())]['user_score']

# Perform the two-sample t-test for Xbox One vs PC
t_stat_xbox_pc, p_value_xbox_pc = stats.ttest_ind(xone_ratings, pc_ratings)

# Output the result
print(f"T-test result for Xbox One vs PC: t-statistic = {t_stat_xbox_pc}, p-value = {p_value_xbox_pc}")


# Hypothesis: Action vs. Sports User Ratings
# We want to test whether the average user ratings for games in the Action and Sports genres differ.

# In[ ]:


# Filter the data for Action and Sports genres
action_ratings = df_games[(df_games['genre'] == 'Action') & (df_games['user_score'].notna())]['user_score']
sports_ratings = df_games[(df_games['genre'] == 'Sports') & (df_games['user_score'].notna())]['user_score']

# Perform the two-sample t-test for Action vs Sports
t_stat_action_sports, p_value_action_sports = stats.ttest_ind(action_ratings, sports_ratings)

# Output the result
print(f"T-test result for Action vs Sports: t-statistic = {t_stat_action_sports}, p-value = {p_value_action_sports}")


# Explanation:
# Significance Level (Œ± = 0.05): This threshold is commonly chosen as it balances the risk of Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative) errors.
# Interpretation of Results:
# If the p-value is less than the chosen Œ±, you reject the null hypothesis, indicating a statistically significant difference between the groups (platforms or genres).
# If the p-value is greater than Œ±, you fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning there's no significant evidence that the ratings differ between the groups.
# Conclusion:
# Once you have the t-statistics and p-values for both tests, you can conclude:
# 
# Whether the average user ratings for Xbox One and PC are the same or different.
# Whether the average user ratings for Action and Sports genres are statistically different.

# Correct.

# ### **General Conclusion**
# 
# The analysis of video game sales across platforms and regions provides several key insights:
# 
# 1. **Platform and Regional Preferences**:
#    - **North America and Europe** are dominated by platforms such as **Xbox** and **PlayStation**, while **Nintendo** platforms are more successful in **Japan**.
#    - The platform lifecycle shows that platforms typically remain popular for around 7-10 years, after which their market share declines. Older platforms like **PS2** and **Wii** are no longer generating sales, while newer platforms such as **PS4** and **Xbox One** are currently leading.
#    
# 2. **Sales Trends by Genre**:
#    - In **North America** and **Europe**, **Action** and **Shooter** genres are the top performers in terms of sales. This suggests a preference for fast-paced, competitive games in these regions.
#    - In **Japan**, **Role-Playing Games (RPGs)** are the dominant genre. The cultural preference for RPGs in Japan is well-known, and the data supports this trend.
#    - Genre-specific trends highlight the importance of regional preferences when targeting markets for new game releases.
# 
# 3. **ESRB Ratings and Sales**:
#    - **Mature (M)**-rated games tend to sell more in **North America**, while **Everyone (E)** and **Teen (T)** ratings have significant market shares as well.
#    - **Japan** shows less of an impact from ESRB ratings compared to North America and Europe, possibly due to cultural differences in content regulation and perception.
#    
# 4. **Platform User Ratings**:
#    - The hypothesis testing between **Xbox One** and **PC** user ratings revealed that, based on the p-value from the t-test, we either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. This provided statistical insight into user perceptions across platforms, which is crucial for developers choosing platforms for game releases.
#    - Similarly, the t-test for **Action** vs **Sports** genre ratings highlighted whether there is a significant difference in user experiences between these two popular genres. Understanding user feedback is essential for improving game quality and meeting audience expectations.
# 
# 5. **Global Market Trends**:
#    - The analysis shows a decline in the number of new game releases post-2010, suggesting market saturation or shifts in consumer interests toward other forms of entertainment, such as mobile gaming and live streaming services.
#    - Sales have also shown regional shifts, with **North America** and **Europe** being more aligned in terms of platform and genre preferences, while **Japan** continues to stand out with different tastes, particularly in RPGs and certain Nintendo platforms.
# 
# ### **Recommendations**:
# - **Target Region-Specific Platforms**: Developers should focus on regionally dominant platforms like **PlayStation** and **Xbox** for the Western market and **Nintendo** platforms for Japan. 
# - **Focus on Genre Preferences**: Tailoring game development to regional genre preferences (e.g., Action and Shooter for the West, RPG for Japan) can improve the chances of success.
# - **Leverage ESRB Ratings**: In North America, developers may benefit from focusing on **Mature (M)**-rated games, which have a significant impact on sales.
# - **Monitor Platform Lifecycles**: Keeping track of platform popularity trends and lifecycle stages is crucial for maximizing sales potential for new game releases.
# 
# ### **Future Outlook**:
# With 2016 data potentially being incomplete, further analysis could be conducted as more recent data becomes available. Additionally, the rise of digital game distribution and mobile gaming could shift market dynamics in the future, which warrants continued analysis of these trends. This analysis serves as a baseline for understanding past trends and can help developers and publishers make informed decisions in a rapidly evolving industry.
