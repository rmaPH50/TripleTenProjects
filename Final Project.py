# # Project Description
# 
# A telecommunications operator named Interconnect wants to predict their customer churn rate. If it's known that a customer is planning to leave, they will be offered promotional codes and special package options. The marketing team at Interconnect has collected some personal customer data, including information about the data packages they've chosen and their contracts.

plt.show()


# Analysis of Senior Citizens and Churn Rate
# 
# The bar chart generated by the code compares the number of customers who churned (Exited = 1) and who did not churn (Exited = 0) based on whether they are senior citizens (SeniorCitizen). Here is the detailed interpretation:
# 
# Non-Senior Citizens (SeniorCitizen = 0):
# 
# There is a significantly larger number of non-senior customers who have not churned compared to those who have churned.
# 
# This group represents the majority of the customer base, and churn appears to be less frequent in this segment.
# 
# Senior Citizens (SeniorCitizen = 1):
# 
# While there are fewer senior citizen customers overall, the proportion of those who churn is relatively higher compared to non-senior citizens.
# 
# This indicates that senior citizens may be more likely to churn compared to younger customers.
# 
# Key Insight:
# 
# The bar chart suggests that senior citizens are at a higher risk of churn, even though they represent a smaller portion of the customer base. This insight can help focus retention strategies specifically on senior citizen customers to reduce their churn rates.

# In[23]:


# correlation check
data_final.corr()


# Key Insights:
# 
# Tenure (Days) is a significant factor: Customers with longer tenure (higher Days) are less likely to churn.
# 
# MonthlyCharges: 
# 
# Higher monthly charges show a weak positive association with churn, which suggests that expensive plans may contribute to customer dissatisfaction.
# 
# Senior Citizens: 
# 
# Senior citizens are slightly more likely to churn and tend to have slightly higher monthly charges.
# 
# TotalCharges: Higher total charges are associated with lower churn, likely due to longer tenure.
# 
# This analysis highlights tenure and monthly charges as key drivers of churn, while senior citizen status may indicate a vulnerable customer segment requiring targeted retention strategies.

# Conclusion for the MonthlyCharges Column:
# 
# The MonthlyCharges column reveals several insights about its relationship with customer churn:
# 
# Positive Correlation with Churn:
# 
# The correlation coefficient (0.19) indicates a weak positive relationship between MonthlyCharges and churn.
# Higher monthly charges slightly increase the likelihood of customers leaving the service.
# 
# 
# Higher Churn Among High-Spending Customers:
# 
# Customers paying higher monthly charges are more likely to churn, potentially due to dissatisfaction with the value provided or affordability concerns.
# 
# 
# Key Segment for Retention:
# 
# High-spending customers represent a critical segment that may require focused retention efforts, such as personalized offers, loyalty rewards, or improved service quality.
# 
# 
# Potential Action Points:
# 
# Evaluate pricing strategies and ensure that high-paying customers perceive the value they are receiving.
# Address service issues or provide additional incentives for customers with higher monthly charges to reduce churn rates.
# 
# By addressing these concerns, the company can improve customer retention and overall satisfaction.

# Analysis Based on Histogram:
# 
# Tenure Distribution:
# 
# Customers with shorter tenure (lower values in the Days column) exhibit significantly higher churn rates compared to long-tenured customers.
# 
# There is a noticeable decline in churn as the tenure increases, indicating stronger customer retention over time.
# Churn Insights:
# 
# New customers are more likely to churn, possibly due to unmet expectations, poor onboarding, or dissatisfaction with initial services.
# 
# Long-tenured customers are generally more loyal, suggesting that customers who pass an initial retention period are less likely to leave.
# 
# 
# Business Implications:
# 
# Focus retention efforts on new customers during their early tenure (e.g., the first few months).
# Improve onboarding processes and provide incentives to encourage customer loyalty from the start.

# Explanation and Insights:
# 
# Summary Statistics Per Client Status:
# 
# The describe() function provides a detailed breakdown of statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for each column, grouped by churn status.
# 
# This breakdown helps identify significant differences between customers who churned (Exited = 1) and those who stayed (Exited = 0).
# 
# 
# Bar Plot Analysis:
# 
# Monthly Charges: Churned customers typically have higher monthly charges than those who stayed, suggesting cost sensitivity.
# Total Charges: Staying customers often have higher total charges, reflecting longer tenure.
# 
# Tenure (Days): Longer-tenured customers are less likely to churn, as expected.
# 
# 
# Business Implications:
# 
# High-paying customers (in terms of monthly charges) may need more attention to prevent churn.
# 
# Focus retention strategies on newer customers, as they are more likely to churn before accruing significant total charges or tenure.

# General Conclusion EDA
# 
# Is there class imbalance in the dataset?
# 
# Yes, there is a significant class imbalance between customers who churned (Exited = 1) and those who stayed (Exited = 0). There are more customers who have not churned, indicating a need for techniques like upsampling or balanced sampling to address this imbalance and improve model performance.
# 
# 
# How do MonthlyCharges affect churn?
# 
# There is a weak positive correlation between MonthlyCharges and churn, with higher charges slightly increasing the likelihood of customers leaving the service. Customers paying higher monthly charges are more likely to churn, indicating potential issues with pricing, service satisfaction, or value for money.
# 
# 
# What is the relationship between customer tenure (Days) and churn?
# 
# A significant relationship exists between tenure (Days) and churn, with shorter-tenured customers being more likely to churn. Customers who have been with the company for a longer period tend to stay, indicating that improving retention for new customers could be critical.
# 
# 
# How do numerical features like Age and TotalCharges relate to churn?
# 
# TotalCharges tends to be higher among customers who have been with the service longer, and staying customers generally accumulate higher charges.
# 
# While Age was not explicitly examined in the analysis, we can infer that more mature customers may exhibit different churn behavior, potentially requiring targeted service packages.
# 
# 
# What is the impact of service types (PhoneService vs. InternetService) on churn?
# 
# Customers with both services (phone and internet) show different churn behaviors, and analyzing these service types individually can help tailor retention strategies.
# 
# The distribution of churn across these features indicates that customers with one or more services are likely to have different retention rates.
# 
# 
# What are the key characteristics of customers who churn vs. those who stay?
# 
# Churned customers generally have higher MonthlyCharges, shorter tenure (Days), and lower TotalCharges.
# Staying customers tend to have longer tenure, lower monthly charges, and higher accumulated charges over time.
# 
# 
# Actionable Insights:
# Retention Efforts: Focus on customers with shorter tenure and high monthly charges to improve retention. Implement strategies to enhance the value perception among high-paying customers.
# 
# 
# Pricing Review: Customers with higher monthly charges may be at risk of leaving. It would be valuable to review pricing plans and offer personalized retention offers.
# 
# 
# Targeted Retention Campaigns: Use insights from tenure and churn distribution to identify at-risk customers early and engage them with offers or improved services.
# 
# 
# By addressing these areas, the company can improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn rates, which in turn will have a positive impact on long-term profitability.

# Class Imbalance: Applying Upsampling
# 
# The upsampling technique helps address class imbalance by increasing the number of instances in the minority class (customers who have churned). After applying the Random OverSampling method, the distribution of the Exited column will be balanced, making it easier for machine learning models to learn from both classes effectively. The class distribution after upsampling will show an equal number of churned and non-churned customers.

# The AUC-ROC score of 0.90 and accuracy score of 0.848 achieved with the LGBM Classifier model suggest that it is highly effective at distinguishing between clients who will remain with the service and those who are likely to churn.

# Conclusion
# 
# In this project, the goal was to build a churn prediction model using a dataset with imbalanced classes. The following steps were carried out to ensure effective model training and evaluation:
# 
# Data Preprocessing and Feature Selection:
# 
# Unnecessary features, such as 'customerID' and 'gender', were dropped from the dataset to focus on relevant features.
# Categorical features were encoded using an ordinal encoder for models that required numerical inputs, while features for the LGBM classifier were converted to a categorical type to leverage the model's ability to handle categorical variables directly.
# 
# 
# Handling Class Imbalance:
# 
# Given the imbalanced nature of the target variable ('Exited'), the upsampling technique was applied to balance the classes by increasing the number of samples in the minority class (churned customers) by a factor of 5.
# 
# 
# Feature Scaling:
# 
# Numerical features like 'MonthlyCharges', 'TotalCharges', and 'Days' were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's performance.
# 
# 
# Model Evaluation and Tuning:
# 
# Logistic Regression: Cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model, achieving an AUC score of approximately 0.837, indicating good performance.
# 
# 
# Random Forest Classifier: A hyperparameter tuning process was conducted by varying the maximum depth of the trees. The best performance was achieved with a max depth of 14, resulting in an AUC score of 0.986, demonstrating strong predictive capability.
# 
# 
# LGBM Classifier: A grid search was conducted to find the optimal parameters for the LGBM classifier, which performs particularly well on categorical features. The best combination of parameters led to an excellent AUC score.
# 
# 
# Final Recommendations:
# 
# Based on the performance metrics (AUC scores), the Random Forest Classifier and LGBM Classifier emerged as the top models, with the Random Forest achieving the highest performance.
# 
# These models can be further fine-tuned to improve their accuracy and used to predict churn effectively in real-world applications.
# 
# The project successfully addressed the class imbalance issue, optimized the models using cross-validation and grid search, and achieved promising results for churn prediction. The models are ready for deployment in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights into customer behavior.
