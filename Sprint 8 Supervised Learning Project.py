# When you work with ML models it's always better to fill missing values instead of to drop rows. When you drop a row beacuse of NaN in one column you lose information from other columns which can be useful for ML traning. So, please, fix it

# Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
# Checked for missing values and displayed the count for columns with missing entries.
# Handled missing values by either dropping rows or filling in values based on appropriate strategies.
# Converted data types to ensure all columns have the correct format for analysis.
# Checked for duplicates and removed any if necessary.
# Reviewed the cleaned dataset to confirm the changes made.
# This process prepares the data for analysis by ensuring it is clean, well-structured, and suitable for modeling. If you need more specific help or additional cleaning tasks, feel free to ask!

# Example Findings
# Imbalance: A significant imbalance might lead the model to predict the majority class (No Churn) well but perform poorly on the minority class (Churn).
# Model Limitations: The model may have high overall accuracy due to the imbalance, but it may not generalize well in practice, especially for predicting churn, which is often the class of interest in customer retention strategies.
# 
# Conclusion
# Training a model without addressing the class imbalance, you can expect to see that the performance metrics for the minority class (churned customers) will likely be suboptimal. You can consider methods to handle the imbalance, such as oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using algorithms designed to work with imbalanced datasets (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting).

# Everything is correct. Good job! But you have 4 different f1 scores here. The main one is f1 score without any averaging for class one. It's better to highlight it or calculate it using a function f1_score in addition to classification_report.

# Step-by-Step Implementation of Undersampling
# Import Necessary Libraries: Ensure you have the necessary libraries imported.
# 
# Load the Data: Load your dataset.
# 
# Check Class Distribution: Examine the balance of classes.
# 
# Undersample the Majority Class: Use random undersampling to balance the dataset.
# 
# Class Weighting: Use model parameters that accept class weights.
# Set the class weights to 'balanced' (which automatically adjusts weights inversely proportional to class frequencies). 
# 
# Train a Model on the Undersampled Data: Train your machine learning model.
# 
# Evaluate the Model: Assess the model's performance.

# Conclusion
# By following the above steps, you should be able to effectively use undersampling to address class imbalance in your dataset. The classification report will help you understand the impact of this technique on your model's performance, particularly for the minority class.

# Conclusion:
# 
# In this project, the goal was to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for Beta Bank and achieve an F1 score of at least 0.59 on the test set. Through the following steps, we successfully developed a robust model that exceeded the F1 score requirement:
# 
# Data Preparation:
# We began by downloading and preparing the dataset, which included information on clients' past behavior and contract termination history. We processed missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features to ensure the data was clean and ready for model training.
# 
# Class Imbalance Analysis:
# An initial examination revealed that the dataset was imbalanced, with far more customers who did not churn compared to those who did. This imbalance posed a challenge, as it could lead to a biased model that would overpredict the majority class (non-churn). We trained a baseline model without accounting for the imbalance, which resulted in poor F1 performance, as expected.
# 
# Addressing Class Imbalance:
# To improve the model's performance, we employed two approaches to handle the class imbalance:
# 
# Downsampling the Majority Class: 
# 
# We reduced the number of non-churn customers in the training set to balance the classes, which helped the model focus more on the minority class.
# 
# Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV: 
# 
# We utilized GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for the model. This further improved the performance by fine-tuning the classifier to handle the complexities of the dataset.
# 
# Model Evaluation:
# After training different models using the training and validation sets, we selected the best-performing model based on the F1 score. We then evaluated the model on the test set, achieving an F1 score of 0.6056, surpassing the project requirement of 0.59. Additionally, we measured the model's AUC-ROC, which provided further insight into its ability to distinguish between classes.
# 
# rf_final_model = RandomForestClassifier(
#     max_depth=10, 
#     min_samples_leaf=3,
#     min_samples_split=5,
#     n_estimators=100,
#     random_state=42,
#     class_weight='balanced' 
# 
# Final Results:
# Final Test F1 Score: 0.6056
# Final Test Accuracy: 0.8307
# 
# Overall, the model successfully predicted customer churn with satisfactory accuracy and met the F1 score target. By handling class imbalance and tuning hyperparameters, we were able to build a model that will assist Beta Bank in retaining customers more effectively.
