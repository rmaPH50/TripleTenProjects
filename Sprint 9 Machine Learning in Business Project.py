# Project Description: 
# 
# The user is working for OilyGiant Mining Company, tasked with identifying the best location for a new oil well. The project involves the following steps:
# 
# Collecting Data: Gather data on oil well parameters in selected regions, including oil quality and volume of reserves.
# 
# Building a Predictive Model: Develop a model to predict the volume of reserves in new wells.
# 
# Selecting Top Wells: Identify the oil wells with the highest predicted reserve volumes.
# 
# Profit Analysis: Determine the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells.
# 
# The user is analyzing the potential profit and associated risks by using the Bootstrapping technique to assess the profitability of wells across three regions, ultimately choosing the region that offers the best profit margin.

# 1. The code is broken because there is not function `bootstrap_profit_with_noise`
# 2. The results I saw before I ran your code were incorrect. In the correct results risk in each region should be a value between 0 and 10% but not exact 0.

# Based on the analysis, Region 1 is the most suitable location for oil well development. The key factors in this decision are as follows:
# 
# Average Profit: 
# 
# Region 1 offers the highest expected average profit, estimated at approximately $4,464,520.26. This is a favorable indicator of the region's potential return compared to the other regions.
# 
# Risk of Loss: 
# 
# Region 1 meets the acceptable risk threshold, with only a 1.9% risk of incurring losses. This is well within the companyâ€™s risk tolerance of 2.5%, unlike Regions 0 and 2, which have higher risks of 7.0% and 8.9%, respectively.
# 
# Confidence Interval: 
# 
# The 95% confidence interval for Region 1â€™s profit ranges from $408,833.00 to $8,296,767.05. Although this range suggests some variability, it remains positive throughout, indicating a strong likelihood of profit.
# 
# In conclusion, Region 1 has the highest profitability with a manageable risk, making it the recommended choice for new well development. This decision is expected to maximize returns while adhering to the company's risk management criteria.
