# # Project description
# 
# Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction.
# 
# The RMSE metric on the test set should not be more than 48.
# 
# ## Project instructions
# 
# 1. Download the data and resample it by one hour.
# 2. Analyze the data.
# 3. Train different models with different hyperparameters. The test sample should be 10% of the initial dataset. 
# 4. Test the data using the test sample and provide a conclusion.
# 
# ## Data description
# 
# The data is stored in file `taxi.csv`. The number of orders is in the '*num_orders*' column.

# Convert the 'datetime' column to datetime format
data['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['datetime'])

# Resample the data by hour (assuming the 'num_orders' column contains the number of orders)

# ## Training

# Conclusion:
# 
# Based on the RMSE values obtained from the various models tested for predicting taxi orders for the next hour, we can draw the following conclusions:
# 
# Model Performance:
# 
# XGBoost delivered the lowest RMSE of 29.01, outperforming both Random Forest (RMSE: 31.03) and LightGBM (RMSE: 31.76). 
# 
# This indicates that XGBoost provides the most accurate predictions for the task at hand among the three models.
# 
# All models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost) have RMSE values well below the threshold of 48, indicating they are performing well with respect to the prediction of taxi orders.
# 
# Feature Engineering:
# 
# The creation of lag features (lags of 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours) was beneficial for the models, as they accounted for past orders to improve the predictive accuracy.
# 
# Additionally, the inclusion of time-related features like the hour, day of the week, and month, as well as a rolling mean of the last 3 hours, likely helped capture the temporal trends and patterns in the data.
# 
# Overall Model Selection:
# 
# XGBoost has proven to be the best model among the candidates in terms of RMSE, making it a suitable choice for this project. 
# It provides reliable and efficient predictions for taxi orders in the next hour, contributing to the goal of attracting more drivers during peak hours.
# 
# Random Forest and LightGBM, while still producing strong results, were slightly less accurate than XGBoost, though their RMSE values still suggest their practicality in certain situations.
# 
# In conclusion, while all tested models perform well in predicting taxi orders, XGBoost is the preferred choice for achieving the best results, and its performance well exceeds the required RMSE threshold of 48. 
# 
# Further model refinements, including hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering, could enhance these results even more.
